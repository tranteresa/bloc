##**The Design Process**

Design Process Step | Experience Ranking | Reason
------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------
**Discovery** | Medium | In my current position I work in product management. For NPIs (New Product Introductions), we follow a similar format for developing new products. Discovery phase is similar to what we call a project charter. We define the project scope, first priority goals, second priority goals, resource requirements, general timeline, technical specs, etc. 
**Strategy** | Medium | This phase is similar to our PSM (Project Schedule Meeting). Over the course of 2-3 days, team members discuss project requirements, target audience for the product, and define the development plan. A risk analysis is discussed during the meeting to mitigate potential risk. Business Managers are responsible for understanding the current market and gear projects to strategically align with business goals - they act as the customer stakeholder. 
**Information Architecture** | Low | The industry I work in is Semiconductors. Generally this and the next two topics were primary engineer driven due to the technical scope. Engineers will try to reuse existing building block technology to reduce engineering time. Take note that the portfolio manage could be years old and technology is constantly changing. 
**Visual Design** |Low| I have little experience with this phase as I worked with physical products and manufacturing. Most visual design is handled by our Marketing Department for Product Introductions. 
**Development** | Low| Little experience with this phase as well. I held the position of website developer for one of my clubs. This position required little to no coding as I used Wix - Website Builder. 
**Launch** | Medium | We call this phase Product Introduction. In this phase the manufacturing, test, and other NPI requirements are completed. To ensure a successful transition for New Product to Production status, we document, review project specs, and confirm customer forecast to ensure the product can be supported when introduced.
